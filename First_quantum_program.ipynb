Such calculations can certainly be performed by a classical computer! The catch is that they very quickly become intractable as the size of the quantum circuits being simulated grows. qiskit also provides a functionality for simulating quantum circuits. You will mostly be running classical simulations of the quantum circuits that you write, but you will sometimes run them on actual quantum devices as part of your homeworks. Once you have written the code for a simulation of a quantum circuit, running it on an actual quantum device will be as simple as changing one argument in your code. "
